I just want a placeholder front end to visualize the idea, just 2 screen: main screen: each feature is 1 box, 2 section for tool and workflow, menu left panel to navigate, hide left panel in mobile mode  -> build this main screen only feature screen: click box -> go to feature, button to go back, -> put as placeholder this should run on Tauri, web, andriod, ios ok
